# Warehouse
An e-commerce backend. Used to manage basic inventories and inventory information.

To use this app, use the mysql cli to `SOURCE` the `schema.sql` file located in
the db folder. Then you can use either `npm start` or `node index.js` to start the server. Then use an app such as insomnia or postman to test route functionality.
